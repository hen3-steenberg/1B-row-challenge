# 1B-row-challenge
This is all of my attempts at completeing the [1 billion row challenge](https://www.morling.dev/blog/one-billion-row-challenge/)

## Data
The data is generated from the `data-generator.cpp` program using the 'stationlist.txt' file which is a file containing all of the station names, one name per line.
The 'stationlist.txt' file is generated from the 'test-data.csv' file which is a smaller file with representative data.
